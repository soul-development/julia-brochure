      "Greetings and Welcome,",
      "My name is Julia Barinova, MBA. I am a New York City-based licensed insurance advisor and broker with over 20 years of experience in life, disability, critical and chronic illness, and long-term care insurance planning. I'm licensed to offer life and health insurance products in nearly 40 states and conduct consultations by phone, ZOOM or in-person in my Brooklyn, NY office.",
      'A few years ago, while searching for a dental plan for myself to cover an implant—one without the typical 6- or 12-month waiting periods or the "missing tooth" clause that excludes implants and crowns—I discovered a unique opportunity: a MetLife PPO dental plan available through an association.',
    ],

    2: [
      'I was intrigued. I joined the association for a modest $5 monthly membership fee, enrolled in the plan, and within just one month, was able to begin the major dental treatments I needed. Thrilled with the results, I asked my two dentists whether such a plan would be welcomed by their offices—and both responded with an enthusiastic "Yes!" From that point forward, the rest is history. Excited, I signed up as a Broker with the organization behind the plan, driven by the desire to help clients get access to much needed benefits and save money.',
      "Over the past three years, nearly 1,000 satisfied clients have enrolled in these dental—and other: vision, PPO health, guaranteed life insurance, and critical illness—plans. Today, nearly 20 dental offices across New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Miami actively endorse these plans to their patients and are happy with how they work and pay.",
      "The benefit is mutual: Patients save money on expensive treatments, and dentists find that clients agree to treatment plans faster and more confidently. These PPO plans have large national networks and are widely accepted by both in-network and out-of-network providers across the country.",
    ],

      "By joining Elevate Wellness, a network supporting thousands of small business owners, employees, and self-employed (1099) individuals, you gain access to high-quality benefits at competitive rates—plans with terms and advantages typically unavailable to individuals on the open market.",
      "I'm proud to be a representative of the insurance organization behind this opportunity and excited to help you access the benefits you need—saving you money, simplifying the process, and offering you the protection and peace of mind you deserve.",
      "Since almost everyone who expresses interest in these dental offers asks similar questions about how the plans work and which one to choose, I've put together a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list to help you make an informed decision and register with confidence.",
